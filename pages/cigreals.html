    <h2>How to make Cigreals:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Choose your vessel</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Select a bowl that reflects the emptiness of your existence. This vessel will carry the weight of your breakfast epiphany.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Pour the milk</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Gently pour the milk into the bowl. It is recommended to use milk sourced from cows who have contemplated the futility of their pasture existence.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Arrange the Cigarettes</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Strategically place the cigarettes around the bowl, forming a circle of existential angst. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nutrition Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Calories: As meaningless as the concept of time.</li>
        <li>Protein: Existentially sourced.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chef's Note</h2>
    <p>
        Take a moment to marvel at the absurdity of your creation. 
        As you gaze into the bowl, contemplate the choices that led you to this point – a breakfast that's essentially a silent scream into the nothing.
